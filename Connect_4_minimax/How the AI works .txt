How the AI works 
 -horizontal block
 -vertical block

-random move AI
  --introducing delay
  --just randomly generating a colum in response to the player
  --primitive, can't really block moves
  --turn itself is random

-usage of scoring mechanisms
  --coming up with a means of quantifying a state
  --score calculation for all pieces of a type
    ---three consec
    ---four scoring
    ---two consec
    ---blocking

-picking the best move 
 --running the score calcn on every possible move 
 --deciding upon based on the context 

-The minmax algorithm
 --each level represents the state of board after a player makes a move
 --at each level players oppose each other (min - max)
   --the opponent minimizes the max player's gains
   --thus both the players make the optimal move at each turn
   --and a global optima is choosen
